## Development Journey
I started my dev journey in 2013, as a student of Information technology in the Eastern Mediterranean University, Cyprus, I obtained 215 ECTS on the way to obtain my BSc in Information Technology. 
I started off creating simple websites using adobe dreamweaver. I got familiar with HTML and CSS, and this opened a new world of possibilities. 
</br>
For a while, I got into creating games using Unity game Engine and C#. I have some experience with object-oriented programming using C++ as my main tool.
A lot of personal projects have helped in building my development skills over the years, and I look forward to more interesting projects
