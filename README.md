#  Web Developer
## About me
ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Amenya, I am a Software developer mainly (but not limited to web applications), currently a freelance developer. </br> 
</br>
</br>
## Development Journey
I started my dev journey in 2013, backl in my uni days, although i do find it quite interesting it took me a couple years to get a hang of it all. Not that I necessarily had issues understanding it all,
but I'd say difficulties stemmed mainly from not seeing any real implications of programming languages.. I guess now I realize the onus was on oneself but for a long time I'm just solving bland exam
algorithm focused problems which I find quite repetitive and not motivativating enough to really enjoy the beauty of creation, to an extent, there is some art in code I would say.
I started off creating simple websites with the infamous adobe dreamweaver. I got familiar with HTML and CSS, and this opened a new world of possibilities. 
</br>
The real shift happened when I got into creating games with Unity so I had to write some C#, up till that point, I had never had such gratification from creating something. It was mind blowing I could do
this for free basically, just costs time, patience, and a lot of math. 
I was able to really implement OOP and understand the concept in real world use, and not just some abstract exam. I realized basically, all programming languages are weirdly interlinked, and the only reason
we do not have one language is cause a bunch of perfectionist-ass nerds decide their predecessor is just not good enough, and we will never lack perfectionist-ass nerds so instead of making one Omega language 
which I think we're closer than ever to, we get the swarm we have today which are really all the same inherently aside a few exceptions.
Excuse the rant lol... I had to study JAVA in uni. Iykyk

I've worked on a lot of personal projects which have helped in building my development skills over the years, and also Invested financially in some ventures which may have not been the greatest successes but have
helped definitely in understanding real-world code base and how to manage uptime and high traffic. Since I stupidly do every single thing myself, and I mean everything. Currently, I have a homelab project which in
following days, I will upload to github, also remake of my portfolio and I need to clean up the blog and CMS i made, I think the UI is super clean for a blog but we do have internal plans with that project also.
2025, I think will be amazing as a dev. 
Languages I am familiar with can be found below:
